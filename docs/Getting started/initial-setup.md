After installing PickZ for the first time, you will have an mostly empty environment which will need to be filled! Let's start by adding some locations, products and contacts.

## Locations

Locations are needed to store products, every location should represent a physical location in the warehouse, so PickZ knows where to store the items, there are several types of locations:

### Bulk location

These are locations for bulk storage, large spaces where you store your incoming orders (putaway) and from where you replenish your pick locations.

### Pick locations

These are usually smaller locations, used for order picking.

### Staging locations

Locations where products are packed, unpacked, assembled, checked, etcetera.

:::tip
PickZ needs at the very least one Bulk location in order to function properly

PickZ added several example locations on installation, either rename them or delete them and create new locations based on your warehouse layout.

## Products

Products are any items stored on a location, and moved through the warehouse when working on inbound or outbound orders. Add any product you have stored are are expecting to store in the warehouse.

You can add new products later on the fly while receiving

## Contacts

Contacts can be either suppliers (inbound) or customers (outbound), PickZ currently makes no distinction between these two, add your clients and suppliers so we can add some orders for them!
