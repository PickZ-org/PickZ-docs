After installing PickZ for the first time, you will have a mostly empty environment which will need to be filled! Let's start by adding some locations, products, and contacts.

### Locations

Locations are needed to store products. Each location should represent a physical area in the warehouse, so PickZ knows where to store the items. There are several types of locations:

* **Bulk locations**
These are locations for bulk storage, large spaces where you store your incoming orders (putaway) and from where you replenish your pick locations.

* **Pick locations**
These are usually smaller locations, used for order picking.

* **Staging locations**
Locations where products are packed, unpacked, assembled, checked, etc.

:::tip
PickZ needs at the very least one **bulk location** to function properly.

PickZ adds several example locations during installation. You can rename or delete these and create new locations based on your warehouse layout.

### Products

Products are any items stored in a location and moved through the warehouse when working on inbound or outbound orders. Add any product you have stored or expect to store in the warehouse.

:::tip
You can add new products later on the fly while receiving.

### Contacts

Contacts can be either suppliers (inbound) or customers (outbound). Currently, PickZ makes no distinction between these two. Add your clients and suppliers so you can create orders for them!
